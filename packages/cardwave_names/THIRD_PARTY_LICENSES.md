# Third-Party Licenses

The frozen name database compiled into `lib/src/services/name_database_data.g.dart`
is a derivative work of the open corpora listed below. Each name in
the database was sourced from one of these; the LLM only adds the
synthetic tags (role, intelligence, allure, themes, etc.) at build
time. Attribution is preserved here so it travels with the package,
in line with the underlying licenses.
